# about me
i am broose too, means soose too. pronouns are they/them

i'm currently a freshman in high school and have been interested in computer software/hardware since age 7.

fun fact: i have gotten in trouble at school for tech-related shenanigans 5 times now

i play a huge part in [rainyware workshop](https://rainyware.rainsounds2.com), as i'm the founder of that disaster waiting to happen

# my interests:
## game development
i love game development mainly because of the game itself, not really how they're developed so i picked up RPG maker MV when it was on sale in july of 2025 and i'm working on my game, "spis". you can read more and even play the beta version [here](https://github.com/Nametag71/spis)

fun fact: the game "omori" was made in RPG maker MV (with plugins ofc)
## computer hardware
messing with computer hardware is among my favorite activites, whether i'm replacing a part or [building some awful fire hazard contraption to cook pepperonis](https://rainyware.rainsounds2.com/projectpages-pepperonicooker/), it's always fun to do

## web development
web development is peak joose, wether i'm just making a basic HTML/CSS site or a whole B-2 spirit stealth website
## music production
my father is a composer for movie trailer type music and so i've been dabbling my arteries in making my own music. [i'm absolute dogshit at making music](https://files.rainsounds2.com/public_files/please-dont-listen-to-this.mp4) but i still try because i know some day i might actually make something half listenable

fun fact: the computer my dad used to make music from 2017-2021 is now the server for all the rainyware services and also a NAS

## game console modding/homebrew
outdated nintendo consoles are peak joose but only when they're modded, if i didn't have my modded 3DS my head would explode twice in a row like it's a magic trick.
## networking
very self explanitory. i do silly network shenanigans all the time and nothing neferious YET (i hope you like saxophone 1) but also VoIP equipment and i hate myself enough to mess with cisco IP phones (if anyone has SCCP or SIP firmware version 7.0.3 for the 7971G, PLEASE contact me). i mainly work with cat 5e/6 and IPv4, i haven't looked into fiber optics and wi-fi is terrifying.

## minecraft modding
i really enjoy playing modded versions of minecraft (especially with friends) and my friend group has had multiple modded survival worlds over the past year and also made a few mods of my own using MCreator

fun fact: i got into modding minecraft cuz i watched youtubers like ThinkNoodles and danTDM play crazy craft 3.0 when i was like 9

## commercial aviation
very different from my other interests but it still counts. i have a few different flight simulators but my personal preferance is x-plane 12, commercial aircraft are among my favorite and i would make a tier list of them if i felt like doing so.

fun fact: boeing 737 is favorite plen
